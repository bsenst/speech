Submission to the assembly.ai hackathon december 2022. https://assemblyai-hackathon.devpost.com/

Medical knowledge is expanding. Keeping up is challenging. Learning opportunities are diverse but demand a huge amount of manual work. AI-generated content can increase speed and reduce effort to create content. This project offers additional content ("tell me more") surrounding the frequent twitter medical Q&A sessions. The additional content can be generated on-the-fly and require minimal supervision to check for correctness. Main part is the parsing of topics (i.e. tweets) and generating content using the https://cohere.ai/ API. In addition a streamlit frontend is provided. This project gave an impression of the possibilities of AI-generated content and huge language models and parameters such as temperature, tokens and presence penalty.
