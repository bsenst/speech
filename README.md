*Learn more about the last Q&A. Get interesting facts surrounding the recent twitter session. Put the facts into context to grow your knowledge and remember it long term.*

[Submission](https://devpost.com/software/speech-o4pl3m) to the [assembly.ai hackathon december 2022](https://assemblyai-hackathon.devpost.com/).

Medical knowledge is expanding. Keeping up is challenging. Learning opportunities are diverse but demand a huge amount of manual work. AI-generated content can increase speed and reduce effort to create content. This project offers additional content ("tell me more") surrounding the frequent twitter medical Q&A sessions. The additional content can be generated on-the-fly and requires supervision only to check for correctness. Main part is the parsing of topics (i.e. tweets) and generating content using the [cohere.ai](https://cohere.ai/) API. In addition a streamlit frontend is provided. This project gave an impression of the possibilities of AI-generated content and huge language models and parameters such as temperature, tokens and presence penalty.
